# Module 5 – Sponsorship Packages & Proposals

Create clear, tiered sponsorship offerings that showcase **real value** to sponsors, backed by examples and impact storytelling.

---

## 1. T.A.P. Sponsorship Tiers (Example Structure)

Offering multiple tiers makes it easier for sponsors to say “yes” at the level that fits their budget and goals.  
Below is an example 4-tier structure that you can adapt.

---

### Pricing Psychology Tips

When designing your tiers:

- Offer **3–4 tiers** to create choice, without overwhelming  
- Make the **middle tier** the most attractive (anchor effect)  
- Show **clear value progression** between tiers (more reach, more touchpoints, more engagement)  
- Use “**+ Custom**” on the highest tier to signal flexibility  
- Present pricing **annually** (instead of monthly) to reduce “sticker shock”

---

### Example Reach Estimates (Illustrative Only)

> **Note:** These are **example figures** for illustration, not actual projections.

Assume example monthly reach per T.A.P. station: **5,000 people**.

- 1 station → ~5,000 monthly reach (example)  
- 2 stations → ~10,000 monthly reach (example)  
- 5 stations → ~25,000 monthly reach (example)  
- Social media: ~300 additional people per post (example)  

These numbers will need to be replaced with **real T.A.P. data** as you collect it.

## 2. Case Study: Pacific Beach Coalition (PBC)

The Pacific Beach Coalition, a San Diego–area environmental nonprofit, provides a strong **real-world sponsorship example** T.A.P. can learn from.

### Their Sponsorship Model (Example: \$1,500/year)

They offer clear benefits tied to **specific audience numbers**.

---

### Key Takeaways for T.A.P.

1. **Transparent Reach Metrics**  
   - PBC lists specific audience numbers (newsletter, events, social media).  
   - T.A.P. should similarly quantify station reach, website visitors, and social followers wherever possible.

2. **Multiple Visibility Channels**  
   - They leverage newsletters, events, website, and social media.  
   - T.A.P. can bundle **station signage** with **digital presence** (website, email updates, social).

3. **Customization Options**  
   - PBC explicitly offers customizable sponsorships.  
   - T.A.P. should emphasize flexibility, especially for larger sponsors.

4. **Mission-Driven Value**  
   - PBC highlights support for environmental education, community engagement, and coastal preservation.  
   - T.A.P. should lead with its **environmental + community impact story**, not just logo placement.

5. **Event-Based Opportunities**  
   - EcoFest (5,500+ people) is a strong anchor event.  
   - T.A.P. can create event-style opportunities (Earth Day activations, trail cleanups, etc.) for extra sponsor visibility.

---

### Action Items for T.A.P.

- Calculate and publish **real reach metrics** (station foot traffic, website visitors, social followers).  
- Create a **“Become a Sponsor”** page with clear tiers and benefits.  
- Bundle **physical presence** (station signage) + **digital presence** (newsletters, social, site).  
- Lead with the **mission and impact story**.  
- Offer **custom options** for sponsors with unique needs or higher budgets.

---

## 3. Building Credibility Through Community Partnerships

While individual T.A.P. station usage is valuable, **scheduled partnerships** with community organizations provide:

- Concrete, verifiable engagement  
- Reliable audiences  
- Stronger stories for sponsors  

### Quantifiable vs. Estimated Impact

- **Less Reliable:**  
  > “Our stations get approximately 5,000 monthly visitors.”  
  Hard to verify, may vary significantly.

- **More Reliable:**  
  > “We partner with Boy Scout Troop 247 (45 members) for monthly trail maintenance events.”  
  Concrete, countable, and credible.

---

### Example Community Partnership Opportunities

- **Boy Scouts / Girl Scouts**  
  - Monthly service projects  
  - 20–50 youth plus leaders; strong family audience  
- **Local Schools**  
  - Quarterly environmental field trips  
  - 3–4 schools → 200+ students/year  
- **Running / Hiking Clubs**  
  - “Adopt-a-Trail” programs with weekly runs  
  - 100 members × weekly runs → ~5,200 impressions/year  
- **Environmental Nonprofits**  
  - Joint Earth Day events, cleanups, workshops  
  - Leverage their volunteer base and credibility  
- **Corporate Volunteer Programs**  
  - Recurring employee volunteer days  
  - Turnkey CSR opportunity for companies

---

### Benefits for Sponsor Conversations

Scheduled community partnerships give you:

- **Concrete numbers**  
  - “50+ monthly Scout volunteers” beats “lots of trail users.”  
- **Documented impact with photos**  
  - Sponsors see real people using stations.  
- **Third-party validation**  
  - Scouts, schools, or nonprofits vouching for the work.  
- **Backup when estimates are questioned**  
  - You can lean on guaranteed program participation.  
- **Activation opportunities**  
  - Sponsors can show up, provide snacks, branded gear, or staff.

---

### Action Steps to Build Partnerships

- Identify **3–5 local organizations** aligned with T.A.P. (Scouts, schools, clubs, environmental groups).  
- Propose **recurring** (monthly/quarterly) events instead of one-offs.  
- Document **participation numbers**, take photos, and gather **testimonials**.  
- Create a **“Community Partners”** page on your website.  
- Include partnership stats in sponsor proposals as **guaranteed reach**.  
- Offer sponsors the chance to **activate** at these events.

> **Big Idea:** Community partnerships turn your pitch from “we estimate X users” into “we guarantee engagement with Y specific people through documented programs.”

## 4. Storytelling with Impact Metrics (ROI Narrative)

You don’t need hyper-precise ROI calculations; you need a **compelling impact story** with reasonable numbers.

### Example ROI Story – \$10,000 Gold Sponsor

Assume a Gold package with multiple stations and events:

- **52,000+ impressions/year**  
  - Example: 1,000 weekly path users × 52 weeks  
- **2 tons of litter removed**  
  - Estimated total impact at sponsored stations  
- **500+ community members engaged**  
  - Participants through events, volunteer days, and partner programs  
- **\$5 per person** cost of engagement  
  - Compared to \$50+ per person for many traditional CSR programs  

These figures show that a sponsor’s investment:

- Reaches a large audience  
- Produces tangible environmental outcomes  
- Engages real people at a relatively low cost  

### Make It Real

- Use **specific numbers**, not vague ranges  
- Add **photos and testimonials**  
- Compare your cost per person or impression to other CSR options  
- Highlight **year-over-year growth** where applicable  
- Call out **unexpected positive outcomes** (e.g., media coverage, viral posts)

---

## 5. One-Page Proposal Template

A strong proposal can often fit on **one page** (or two max). It should be visual, scannable, and tailored.

Suggested outline:

- **Header:**  
  - `[Company Logo] + [T.A.P. Logo]`  
  - Title: “Partnership Proposal for [Company Name]”

- **The Opportunity:**  
  - 2–3 sentences on how partnering with T.A.P. helps them demonstrate environmental leadership and engage the local community.

- **Proposed Tier:**  
  - e.g., “Gold – \$10,000/year”

- **Your Benefits:**  
  - 3–6 bullet points tailored to that company (visibility, engagement, impact, employee opportunities).

- **The Impact:**  
  - Stations funded, estimated litter removed, people engaged, impressions generated.  
  - Tie numbers back to their brand and values.

- **Next Steps:**  
  - Clear call to action (e.g., “Schedule a 20-minute call to review this proposal and finalize details.”)

## 6. Creating Custom Packages

Standard tiers are your **baseline**, but customization helps close larger or more specific sponsors.

### When to Customize

- Company has **specific budget constraints**  
- They want **benefits from multiple tiers**  
- They have unique **activation ideas**  
- Very large potential investment (e.g., > \$25K)  
- Talks around **multi-year commitments**

### Customization Ideas

- **Geographic focus:** concentrate stations near their offices/stores  
- **Themed campaigns:** Earth Day, product launches, anniversaries  
- **Employee programs:** quarterly volunteer days, step challenges, internal competitions  
- **Content creation:** case studies, video stories, social media campaigns featuring the sponsor  

> 💡 **Remember:** Start with standard tiers. Only customize **after** a sponsor shows serious interest and you understand their needs.

## 7. Proposal Design Best Practices

Design matters. A clean, professional proposal makes T.A.P. look credible and sponsor-ready.

### Visual Elements

- Use **high-quality photos** of T.A.P. stations in action  
- Include simple **infographics** for impact metrics  
- Show **mockups** of the sponsor logo on stations or materials

### Format Tips

## 8. Final Encouragement

Great packages and proposals:

- Make it crystal clear **what the sponsor gets**  
- Show exactly **what their money makes possible**  
- Highlight the **emotional and reputational win**, not just the transaction  

Focus on **their benefits**, not just your needs—and your sponsorship conversations will feel like a genuine partnership, not a pitch.

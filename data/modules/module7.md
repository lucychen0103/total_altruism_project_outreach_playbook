# Module 7 – Closing & Maintaining Partnerships

Seal the deal, onboard sponsors smoothly, and turn one-year agreements into long-term relationships.

---

## 1. From Verbal “Yes” to Signed Agreement

A verbal “yes” is exciting—but not the finish line. Here’s a simple closing process to follow.

### The Closing Process

1. **Verbal Commitment**

   - Celebrate their decision and thank them.  
   - Confirm key details:
     - Sponsorship **tier**  
     - **Budget / amount**  
     - **Start date** and approximate timeline  
   - Express genuine enthusiasm about the partnership.

2. **Send Agreement Draft (Within 24 Hours)**

   - Email a **sponsorship agreement** promptly.  
   - Include:
     - Clear terms and benefits  
     - Payment amount and schedule  
     - Basic timeline for deliverables  

3. **Address Questions & Revisions**

   - Expect input from **legal, finance, or procurement**.  
   - Be responsive and patient—this is normal.  
   - Stay flexible on small tweaks but protect:
     - Your ability to deliver on time  
     - Your brand and mission integrity  
     - Fair payment timing

4. **Execute & Invoice**

   - Once signed, send the **invoice** according to agreed terms.  
   - Immediately start the **onboarding process** so they feel momentum.

---

### Common Reasons for Delay

Delays are common and usually not a “no.”

- Legal review (often 2–4 weeks)  
- Budget and internal approvals  
- Multiple stakeholder sign-offs  
- Procurement processes and vendor setup  

> ✅ **Mindset:** Stay patient and persistent. Friendly, weekly check-ins are normal and professional.

---

## 2. Basic Contract Considerations (Not Legal Advice)

> ⚠️ **Important:** The following is educational only and **not legal advice**. Always have contracts reviewed by a qualified attorney before finalizing.

### Essential Contract Elements

These are core sections that typically appear in a sponsorship agreement:

- **Parties** – Full legal names of both organizations  
- **Term** – Start date, end date, and any renewal options  
- **Payment** – Amount, due dates, and payment method  
- **Deliverables** – Specific sponsor benefits and when they’ll be delivered  
- **Logo Usage** – Rights, approvals, and any restrictions on how logos are used  
- **Termination** – Under what conditions and with what notice either party can end the agreement  

### Payment Terms to Consider

Common structures:

- **100% Upfront** – Best for smaller or simpler deals  
- **50/50 Split** – Half upfront, half mid-term  
- **Quarterly Payments** – 25% every 3 months (easier for larger sponsors)  
- **Net 30** – Payment due within 30 days of invoice  

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Larger sponsors often prefer quarterly or Net 30 invoicing to match their internal accounting processes.

### Example Contract Outline

Your agreement might include sections like:

- Parties  
- Term  
- Sponsorship Level & Amount  
- Payment Terms  
- Sponsor Benefits & Deliverables  
- Logo/Brand Usage  
- Reporting & Impact Updates  
- Termination & Renewal  
- Signatures  

(Use this as a **structure guide** only; final legal language should come from a lawyer.)

## 3. Onboarding New Sponsors

Once the agreement is signed, the **first 30 days** set the tone for the whole relationship.

### Onboarding Checklist

Make sure you:

- ✅ Send a **welcome email** with partnership overview and timeline  
- ✅ Request **high-resolution logos** and brand guidelines  
- ✅ Schedule a **kickoff call** with key stakeholders  
- ✅ Share a **detailed deliverables timeline** (signage, reports, events, posts, etc.)  
- ✅ Establish a **single point of contact** on both sides  
- ✅ Plan a **joint social media announcement** (if appropriate)  
- ✅ Set a date for the **first impact report** or update  

> 🌱 **The First 30 Days Are Critical:**  
> Over-communicate early. Share progress, early wins, and introductions. This builds confidence and excitement.

## 4. Nurturing Long-Term Partnerships

Sponsors stay when they feel **seen, informed, and proud** of the partnership.

### Regular Touchpoints

Think in **three rhythms**: monthly, quarterly, and annually.

#### Monthly

- Short impact updates (even 2–3 bullet points)  
- Photos of stations in action  
- Quick community stories or quotes  

#### Quarterly

- More formal impact report  
- Short check-in call or email  
- Feature them on social media or newsletter  

#### Annually

- Year-end comprehensive report  
- Renewal conversation  
- Planning discussion for next year’s opportunities  

---

### Going Above & Beyond

Small, thoughtful gestures make a big difference:

- Handwritten thank-you notes at milestones  
- Surprise extra visibility (extra social posts, newsletter mentions, shout-outs)  
- Inviting sponsors to T.A.P. events or cleanups  
- Creating custom content for their **internal comms** (intranet, employee emails)  
- Publicly acknowledging key people on their team  
- Remembering and celebrating their company milestones (anniversaries, awards, openings)

---

### Building Internal Champions

You want **one or more people inside the company** who love the partnership.

- Keep them in the loop  
- Highlight their role and support  
- Make them look good internally with:
  - Clear reports  
  - Great photos  
  - Positive stories they can forward  

These champions are crucial during budget reviews and renewal decisions.

---

## 5. Renewal Strategy

Don’t wait until the last week of the contract to talk renewal. Work backward from the end date.

### 90 Days Before Expiration

- Start renewal conversations  
- Share early year-end highlights and data  
- Ask about their satisfaction and upcoming goals  

### 60 Days Before

- Present a **renewal proposal**  
- Offer:
  - Upgrade options (higher tier, more stations, added benefits)  
  - Multi-year discounts or bonuses  
- Emphasize **continuity of impact** and momentum  

### 30 Days Before

- Follow up on the proposal  
- Address any remaining questions or concerns  
- If hesitant, suggest:
  - Staying at current level rather than dropping  
  - A shorter renewal period or pilot extension  

### Renewal Success Factors

Renewals are much easier when:

- ✅ You delivered what you promised  
- ✅ You communicated regularly (no long silent gaps)  
- ✅ You provided **measurable impact data**  
- ✅ You built genuine, positive relationships  

---

## 6. Monthly Sponsor Update Template

A consistent monthly email keeps sponsors informed and proud.

You might structure it like:

- **Subject:** `[Month] Impact Update – [Sponsor Name] Partnership`  
- **Sections:**
  - Impact numbers (litter removed, volunteers, hours)  
  - 2–3 photos or visuals  
  - One short “human story” or highlight  
  - What’s coming up next month  

(Use your own tone, but keep it simple, positive, and specific.)

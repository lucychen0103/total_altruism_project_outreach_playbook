Present confidently, run professional sponsor meetings, and handle objections without freezing or overselling.

## 1. Setting Up Professional Meetings

A smooth scheduling experience makes you look prepared and respectful of their time.

### Use a Scheduling Tool (e.g., Calendly – Free Plan)

**Why use Calendly or similar:**

- Eliminates back-and-forth emails about times  
- Looks professional  
- Syncs with your calendar  
- Sends automatic confirmations and reminders  

Recommended basic setup:

- 30-minute meeting duration  
- 24-hour minimum notice  
- Buffer time before/after meetings  
- Confirmation emails enabled  
- Calendar reminders active  

### Ideal Meeting Times

- Best days: **Tuesday–Thursday**  
- Best windows: **10–11 AM** or **2–3 PM** (their timezone)  
- Avoid:  
  - Mondays (catch-up day)  
  - Fridays (people checking out)  
  - Lunch hour (12–1 PM)

## 2. Video Call Best Practices

### Technical Setup

- Test audio and video **10 minutes before**  
- Use good front-facing lighting  
- Ensure a stable internet connection  
- Close unnecessary programs and notifications  
- Have a backup (phone dial-in, hotspot) ready  

### Visual Presence

- Clean, professional background  
- Camera at **eye level**  
- Appropriate attire (business casual is fine)  
- Keep camera on; it builds trust  
- Look into the camera regularly to simulate eye contact  

### During the Meeting

- Join **2–3 minutes early**  
- Mute when you’re not speaking  
- Take short notes (don’t type loudly on mic)  
- Have your deck/proposal ready to share  
- Smile, be warm, and show genuine enthusiasm  

> ⏱ **First impressions matter:** You have about 7 seconds. Don’t obsess over perfection—if tech glitches happen, acknowledge briefly and move on.

## 3. Recommended Meeting Flow (30-Minute Framework)

Use this structure to keep meetings efficient and focused.

### 1. Opening (≈ 5 minutes)

- Thank them for their time  
- Quick personal connection / icebreaker  
- State the **agenda**: what you’ll cover  
- Confirm the **end time** (“We’ll wrap up by XX:YY”)  

---

### 2. Discovery (≈ 7 minutes)

Ask questions and listen—this is where you learn how to tailor your pitch.

Examples:

- “What are your current CSR or community priorities?”  
- “How are you currently engaging employees or local communities?”  
- “What has worked well in past partnerships? What hasn’t?”  

Aim for a **70/30 split**: they talk 70%, you talk 30%.

---

### 3. T.A.P. Presentation (≈ 8 minutes)

Now connect T.A.P. to what you heard in discovery.

- Brief overview of **T.A.P.’s mission and impact**  
- Show visuals of stations in action  
- Present **sponsorship tiers**, but highlight **one recommended option**  
- Share a relevant case study or example  
- Explicitly link T.A.P. to their stated goals (e.g., ESG, community, employees)

---

### 4. Q&A & Next Steps (≈ 10 minutes)

- Invite questions and address concerns calmly  
- Handle objections (see next section)  
- Ask about decision-making process and timeline  
- Agree on clear next steps (proposal, internal review, follow-up meeting, etc.)

---

## 4. Handling Common Objections

Objections are **not rejections**—they usually mean the person is engaged and thinking seriously.

Here are four common ones and example responses.

### Objection 1: “We don’t have budget right now.”

**Sample Response:**

> “I completely understand budget constraints. Many of our partners start with our Bronze tier at \$1,000 annually, which can sometimes come from discretionary or marketing funds. Would it be helpful to look at smaller partnership options or plan for next fiscal year?”

**Tips:**

- Offer **smaller tiers** or pilots  
- Suggest **next fiscal year** planning  
- Ask about **other budget sources** (marketing, ESG, community relations)

---

### Objection 2: “We already have CSR partnerships.”

**Sample Response:**

> “That’s wonderful—you’re exactly the kind of company we love working with. T.A.P. actually complements existing programs. Unlike many CSR initiatives, our model provides immediate, visible community impact that employees can participate in directly. How would you feel about adding T.A.P. as a focused environmental component alongside what you’re already doing?”

**Tips:**

- Position T.A.P. as **complementary, not competitive**  
- Emphasize what’s **unique** (stations, everyday engagement, visible action)  
- Ask about their **current partners** to find gaps T.A.P. can fill

---

### Objection 3: “How do we measure the impact?”

**Sample Response:**

> “Great question. We provide detailed metrics, including: estimated tons of litter removed, number of community participants, hours of environmental service, and social media reach. Our sponsors receive quarterly impact reports with photos and data specific to their sponsored stations.”

**Tips:**

- Have **specific example metrics** ready  
- Show a **sample impact report** if you have one  
- Tie measures to their **ESG or CSR reporting needs**

---

### Objection 4: “We need to discuss internally.”

**Sample Response:**

> “Absolutely, that makes complete sense. To make that conversation easier, would it help if I put together a one-page summary highlighting the key benefits and ROI for your team? When would be a good time to reconnect after everyone’s had a chance to review?”

**Tips:**

- Provide **support materials** (one-pager, deck, summary)  
- Always schedule a **specific follow-up date**  
- Offer to **present to their broader team** if helpful  

---

### The Feel–Felt–Found Technique

A classic, non-pushy framework:

> “I understand how you **feel**. Other companies have **felt** the same way at first. What they **found** was that once we [showed metrics / started small / built a pilot], it actually [benefit].”

This:

- Validates their concern  
- Uses **social proof**  
- Gently reframes the objection

---

## 5. Post-Meeting Follow-Up Strategy

Don’t let a great meeting drift into silence. Follow-up is where deals actually move.

### Within 1 Hour

- Send a short **thank you email**  
- Reference **specific points** from the conversation  
- Include any materials you **promised** (deck, one-pager, links)

---

### Within 24 Hours

- Send a more complete **recap email**:
  - Thank them again  
  - Summarize their priorities in your own words  
  - Attach or link your **proposal**  
  - Confirm **next steps** and **timeline**  
- Connect with your contact on **LinkedIn**

---

### 3–5 Days Later

If you haven’t heard back:

- Send a light follow-up  
- Share **additional value** (case study, impact story, relevant article)  
- Keep tone friendly and non-pushy  

---

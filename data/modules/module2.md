- Grocery stores, hospitals, utility companies  
- Typically easier to access and motivated to support local causes  

#### 3. Environmental / Outdoor Brands
- Outdoor gear companies  
- Sustainable product brands  
- Mission alignment is naturally strong with T.A.P.  

#### 4. Tech Companies
- Strong ESG commitments

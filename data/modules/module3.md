## 2. Who You Should Contact

To maximize sponsorship conversions, focus on roles that:

### **Primary Targets (Best Contacts)**
1. **CSR / Sustainability Manager or Director**

These roles directly own environmental or community programs.

### **Secondary Targets (Still Strong Matches)**
- Marketing VP / Director  
- Partnerships Manager  
- Foundation Director  
- Public Relations Manager  
- Operations Manager (for trail or facility-based programs)

If no CSR role exists, the budget usually sits in Marketing or PR.

### **Where To Look On a Company Website**
Check these pages:
- **About / Leadership**  
- **Sustainability / ESG / Impact**  
- **Community / Corporate Giving**  
- **Press / Media Contacts**

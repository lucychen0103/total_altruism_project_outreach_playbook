# Module 4 – Email Outreach Campaign
Craft compelling emails and automate follow-ups so your outreach is **consistent, scalable, and personalized**.

---

## 1. Email Copywriting Best Practices

Cold outreach is about value + relevance. Use these guidelines to stay concise and effective.

### ✅ DO:
- Personalize with **company-specific details**
- Keep email **under ~150 words**
- Lead with **value**, not a request
- Include **one clear CTA**
- Reference mutual connections if possible
- Mention **recent company news or CSR initiatives**
- Use their **first name**
- Write conversationally

### ❌ DON’T:
- Send generic blast emails
- Write long, dense paragraphs
- Make it about *your* needs only
- Use pushy sales language
- Attach files in the first email
- Ask for money directly
- Use “Dear Sir/Madam”
- Apologize for reaching out

## AIDA Formula for Cold Emails

Structure your email using:

1. **Attention** – Subject line that creates curiosity  
2. **Interest** – Personalized opening sentence  
3. **Desire** – Clear benefit for the company (ESG, PR, community)  
4. **Action** – Simple CTA (reply, short call)

---

## 2. High-Performing Subject Lines

Use these formulas:

- `Partnership opportunity: [Company] x T.A.P.`
- `[First Name], interested in community environmental impact?`
- `Quick question about [Company]’s sustainability initiatives`
- `Loved [Company]’s recent [specific CSR initiative]`
- `[Mutual Connection] recommended I reach out`
- `Environmental partnership for your [location] community`

### Tips:
- Keep under **50 characters**
- Personalize
- Avoid spam triggers (“FREE”, all caps)
- Questions get higher opens
- A/B test 3–5 variations

### **2. Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)**

### **3. Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)**
Ask what stood out. Share top 3 reasons to collaborate + open question.

### **4. Follow-Up #3 (Day ~10)**
Provide school/education impact angle. Great for companies focused on youth.

### **5. Follow-Up #4 (1 week later)**
Explain TAP is expanding partner network — “limited partner slots”.

### **6. Follow-Up #5 (10–14 days later)**
Include specific environmental impact metrics or updates.

### **7. Final Touchpoint (3–4 weeks later)**
